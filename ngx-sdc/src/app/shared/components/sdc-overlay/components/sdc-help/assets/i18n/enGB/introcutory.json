      "title": "# Functional overview",
      "body": "The central focus of the application revolves around components. Each component is linked to a squad and a specific component type or architecture. Each squad, in turn, is associated with a department."
    },
    {
      "body": "The main objective of the application is to define metrics derived from various services such as Sonar and Git. These metrics enable the calculation of a reference value, which helps measure the technical status of a component, squad, or department."

    {
      "body": "To obtain metric values, the application makes API calls to different services. Each API call returns a single string-type result for each metric."
    },
    {
      "body": "The metric configuration defines the expected response type from an API call to a service and how to compare that response with other responses of the same type (e.g., numeric values, versions, etc.)."
    },
    {
      "body": "Metrics are linked to a specific component type or architecture. All components associated with the same type of architecture share the same set of metrics."
