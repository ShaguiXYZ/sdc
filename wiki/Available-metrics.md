These are the available metrics in SDC:

Metric Name | Description | Type | Source | Type of calculation | Thresholds | Component technology | Weight
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
Angular Version | Check that the Angular version used by the component is greater than the one defined in the metric definition | Software Architecture | GIT: We will access the GIT API to analyze the package.json and validate the version used by the SPA | Numerical comparison, greater or equal than | ngx-rws-architecture/versions at master · azibl-common/ngx-rws-architecture (allianz.io) | SPA Angular | medium
Microservice parent version | Check that the version of the parent used by the microservice is greater than the one defined in the metric definition | Software Architecture | GIT: We will access the GIT API to analyze the pom.xml and validate the version used by the microservice | Numerical comparison, greater or equal than | rws-architecture/versions at master · azibl-common/rws-architecture (allianz.io) | RWS | medium
Legacy parent version | Check that the version of the parent used by the legacy service is greater than the one defined in the metric definition | Software Architecture | GIT: We will access the GIT API to analyze the pom.xml and validate the version used by the legacy service | Numerical comparison, greater or equal than | rws-architecture-legacy/versions at master · ePac-Core/rws-architecture-legacy (allianz.io) | RWS - legacy | medium
Critical Vulnerabilities | Critical security vulnerabilities detected on GITHUB (Dependabot) | Security | Access to GIT API to obtain vulnerabilities, we need URL and credentials to access this data | Numerical comparison, less than | 0 | All | high
High Vulnerabilities | High security vulnerabilities detected on GITHUB (Dependabot) | Security | Access to GIT API to obtain vulnerabilities, we need URL and credentials to access this data | Numerical comparison, less than | 5 | All | medium
Medium Vulnerabilities | Medium security vulnerabilities detected on GITHUB (Dependabot) | Security | Access to GIT API to obtain vulnerabilities, we need URL and credentials to access this data | Numerical comparison, less than | 10 | All | low
Low Vulnerabilities | Low security vulnerabilities detected on GITHUB (Dependabot) | Security | Access to GIT API to obtain vulnerabilities, we need URL and credentials to access this data | Informational, no threshold needed | All | 0 |  
Junit coverage | Unit testing coverage | QA | Access Sonar to obtain the coverage percentage associated with the evaluated component | Numerical comparison, greater than | RWS and SPA > 70%. Java Legacy don't have coverage. | RWS and Angular | Low weight for legacy, higher weight for microservices and Angular
Technical Debt | Technical debt in Sonar of the component | QA | Access Sonar to obtain the technical debt in number of days associated with the evaluated component | Numerical comparison, less than | RWS > 10 days alertOthers 30 days but it will probably be balanced and will depend on the component's typology. | All | Low 
Blocker Errors | Blocker errors associated with the component in Sonar | QA | Access Sonar to obtain the number of blocker errors associated with the evaluated component | Numerical comparison, less than | 0 blockers | All | High 
Critical Errors | Critical errors associated with the component in Sonar | QA | Access Sonar to obtain the number of critical errors associated with the evaluated component | Numerical comparison, less than | RWS and SPA 0Legacy no limit | All | Medium 
Code lines | Lines of code associated with the component in Sonar | QA | Access Sonar to obtain the lines of code associated with the evaluated component | Informational, no threshold needed | All | 0 |  
Code smells | Code smells associated with the component in Sonar | QA | Access Sonar to obtain the number of code smells associated with the evaluated component | Numerical comparison, less than | RWS and SPA > 20 days Legacy > 100 days | All | Very low 
Shared library dependency | Dependencies with Shared Libraries for non-legacy REST services | Software Architecture | Access GIT API to check if any of the previously identified shared libraries are used | Boolean comparison | If the component uses this technology, metric is not satisfied used, no threshold needed | RWS architecture 7 | High 
Parent architecture | Parent architecture used by the component | Software Architecture | Check the type of architecture parameterized in the application, no repository access required | Boolean comparison| If the component uses this technology, metric is not satisfied used, no threshold needed | Different weight for each parent Except COBOL | Medium
